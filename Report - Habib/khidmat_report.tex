\section{Introduction}

\subsection{About the Khidmat}
% Use first person plural (we, us) even if you did the Khidmat individually.

% An introduction of the project, no more than 2 sentences. Provide the highest level of detail only. Other details will come later.
% Typically, "This project is to <short description of porject> for/at <client>."
This project is to develop a mobile application for The Citizens Foundation (TCF) to guide their alumni through educational and career pathways.

\subsection{About the client}
% About the client.
TCF is one of Pakistan's leading organisations in the field of education for the less privileged. TCF also maintains a dedicated alumni network and support ecosystem. \href{https://www.tcf.org.pk}{www.tcf.org.pk}.

\subsection{About the project}
% About the project.
The project involves the development of the TCF Alumni Pathways Mobile App â€” a user-friendly digital platform aimed at bridging the gap between TCF alumni and their academic goals. In its initial phase, the app will provide guidance on applying for matric and intermediate education, while later versions will assist alumni with university education. Deliverables include a working prototype app, a connected and populated database, an admin panel for managing the app's content and a server-side API to run the app. We will also guide on how to use and maintain the app, and provide documentation for future development.

\subsection{Plan of work}
% About the plan of work.
We will follow a remote work model under the supervision of \href{mailto:jamila.khaskheli@tcf.org.pk}{Jamila Khaskheli} and \href{mailto:syed.asfand@tcf.org.pk}{Syed Asfand Hussain Shah} from TCF.With regular bi-weekly check-ins. The project will span from February to May 2025. The project will be done slowly over the course of about 8 weeks.

\section{Conclusion}

% Remind the reader about the project. Summarise your activities over the course of the project.
The project was to develop a mobile application for The Citizens Foundation (TCF) to guide their alumni through educational and career pathways. The project was to create a MVP of the alumni pathways app system to propose the project to higher management. We will continue on the project on testing, bug fixing and maintenance. Over the course of the project we learned about a lot of different technologies and tools. We also learned about the importance of documentation and how to work in a team. We also learned about the importance of communication and how to work with a client. The project was a great learning experience for us and we are grateful to TCF for giving us this opportunity. Special thanks to our supervisors, namely Jamila Khaskheli and Syed Asfand Hussain Shah, for their guidance and support throughout the project.
